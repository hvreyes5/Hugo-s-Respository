            <p>We have over 50,000 wonderful used books, records, videos, magazines, and more at our
monthly sale.</p>

<p>Our Main Room is along the north driveway, adjacent to the Charleston Shopping Center
(see map below). In this room, hardbound books start at $1 each and paperback books at 50
cents each. Please bring your large book donations to this room too.</p>

        <p>Children's books, music, videos, and toys are in our new room (near the Cubberley track,
Pavilion and the Greendell School), where you'll find many items for 50 cents or $1, including
picture books, school age fiction and nonfiction, non-English language books, CDs and DVDs,
and books for parents and teachers.</p>

        <p>Bargain books are in rooms K6 and K7, where hardbound books are all $1, paperbacks are 50
cents each, and children's books are just 25 cents. On Sunday, prices in the bargain room are
half-off. Please note that the Children's and Bargain rooms open one hour
earlier than the Main room on Saturday.</p>
        <p>You can save even more money by purchasing grocery bags from us for $5 each and then
filling these with books. You can also purchase gift certificates at the sale in $5 denominations</p>

        <p>Because of our severe space limitations and issues of health and safety, we will only
allow 160 customers into the Main Room at a time. We hand out a maximum of two numbered tickets per person at the Main Room, beginning at 8 am on the
Saturday of the sale. If you receive a ticket, the number on it reserves your corresponding place
in the line, allowing you to go off and get coffee or to visit the Children's and Bargain Book
rooms. Please be sure to return to the Main Room a few minutes before it opens to reclaim your
spot in the line: if you miss the time when your number is allowed to enter the Main Room you
will forfeit your place in line.</p>

<p>Once inside,
customers may take only 12 books off of shelves, after which they should purchase these and
exit via the east door. They may then join at the end of any remaining line at the north door and
reenter in that order. The limitation of 12 books at a time will continue past noon if a line
remains outside.</p>

<p>You'll find these same low prices on all the other tens of thousands of books that we
have. We give 100% of your purchase to help local libraries. Plus, we charge no sales tax and we have the friendliest sales people youâ€™ll ever
find.</p>
